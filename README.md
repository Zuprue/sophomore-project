Here's some of the GUI, so far. I'm just trying to get all the FORCE entries to work, right now. When I have all the bugs worked out, I'll activate all the other variable entries.

To run it, dump all the java files into the SRC folder, in a Netbeans JavaFX project.
In the SRC folder, create an "images" folder, and put the .jpgs in there.
