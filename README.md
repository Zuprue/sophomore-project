Here's some of the GUI, so far. I'm just trying to get all the FORCE entries to work, right now. When I have all the bugs worked out, I'll activate all the other variable entries.

To run it, start a new project in Netbeans (probably should name it javafxapplication10, since that's what this one is called).
- JavaFX - JavaFXML Application.

Delete whatever's in the SRC folder, and dump all these java files into it 

In the SRC folder, create an "images" folder, and put the .jpgs in there.
